 * Tetrahexagesimal is the numbersystem with base 64 means:
 * 
 * 0  = 0
 * 1  = 1
 * ...
 * 9  = 9
 * 10 = a
 * 11 = b
 * ...
 * 35 = z
 * 36 = A
 * 37 = B
 * ...
 * 61 = Z
 * 62 = _
 * 63 = -
 * 64 = 10
 * 65 = 11
 * ...
 * 
 * With this technique you can write numbers from 0 to 4095 with only 2 charakters
 * e.g. 4095 = --
 * that save a lot of space in the serial transmittion
